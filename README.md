# kaprekara_num_app

<p>The Kaprekar sequence is a process in which any 4-digit number from 1000 to 9999 is selected. Then the maximum and minimum numbers are formed from its digits, and the difference between them is calculated. This process is repeated until the number 6174 is received.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, there are 68 special 4-digit numbers that do not obey this sequence and will not result in the number 6174. Try to find these 68 numbers and see their distinctive features.</p>
